This is a Derivative Work of the original HtmlTags and "reboot" FubuMVC.UI projects available from

http://github.com/DarthFubuMVC/fubumvc


I have included the compiled HtmlTags assembly and copied all necessary classes/files from FubuMVC.UI and FubuMVC.Core to get this adapter to compile against Microsoft MVC 1.0. Directory structures have mostly been left in tact and namespaces are the original.
